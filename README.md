## My process

I created a container and nested two divs inside of it. The first div was used to hold the product image and the second div the product information. I set a fixed width for the container and let the image and product div take 50% width each. I then gave the container a display flex to control the directions of the two divs. In the image div, I added the mobile and desktop image to the container and set the mobile image to display none for desktop and vise versa for mobile. I added padding, borders, font-style and sizes, and color to replicate the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how important specifity is in css when styling elements. I encountered some issues adding styles to the span element and was forced to use the !important property. I however, reviewed the css and made changes to apply the styles to the span element without the need of the !important property.

### Continued development

I'm currently learning react and although I'm lagging in javascript. I'm hoping to improve on it while diving deep into react.
